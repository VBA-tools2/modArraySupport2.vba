Excel VBA module with functions for (VBA) arrays.

This is essentially a rewrite of Charles H. Pearson's {uri-cpearson-modArraySupport}.
Thank you for the great work!

This repository exists to bundle and publish all improvements made to the original module.

== Features

* (hmm, do _you_ have a good idea for this point?)

== Prerequisites / Dependencies

None.

== How to install / Getting started

Add the modules in the link:../src[src] folder to your project.
Yes, its that simple.

== Usage / Show it in action

A typical use case to use the functions is when you write functions that need a _vector_ and should work with data from VBA and/or from a worksheet.
In VBA you of course directly create the (1D) vector, but when reading vector data from a worksheet, you get a (2D) _array_/a matrix.
Here is the code I usually use to get the vector, where 5 functions of this project are used.
(This is used e.g. in `+modPolynomReg+`.)

[source,vba]
----
Private Function ExtractVector( _
    ByVal Source As Variant, _
    ByRef DestVector As Variant _
        ) As Boolean

    Select Case NumberOfArrayDimensions(Source)
        Case 2
            If UBound(Source, 1) > 1 And UBound(Source, 2) = 1 Then
                If Not GetColumn(Source, DestVector, 1) Then Exit Function
            ElseIf UBound(Source, 1) = 1 And UBound(Source, 2) > 1 Then
                If Not GetRow(Source, DestVector, 1) Then Exit Function
            Else
                Exit Function
            End If
        Case 1
            If Not CopyArray(Source, DestVector, False) Then Exit Function
            Dim N As Long
            N = UBound(DestVector) - LBound(DestVector) + 1
            If Not ChangeBoundsOfVector(DestVector, 1, N) Then Exit Function
        Case 0
            ReDim DestVector(0)
            DestVector(0) = Source
        Case Else
    End Select

    ExtractVector = True

End Function

== Running Tests

Yes, {uri-UnitTests}[Unit Tests] in Excel _are_ possible.
For that you need to have the awesome {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck] AddIn installed (and enabled).

. Open the Visual Basic Editor (kbd:[Alt+F11])
. Add test modules
  * Code Explorer (of Rubberduck)
    .. Show up the Code Explorer (kbd:[Ctrl+R])
    .. Select the project (or an item of that) to which you want to add the test files
    .. Right-click in the Code Explorer and click: menu:Add[Existing files...]
    .. Select the file(s) in the link:../tests[tests] folder and click Open
  * Project Explorer
    .. Show up the Project Explorer (kbd:[Ctrl+R])
       (Hit it twice if the Code Explorer shows up first)
    .. Drag the files in the link:../tests[tests] folder (in an Explorer window) and drop them on the Project in the Project Explorer to which you want to add the tests
. Check that the files from the link:../src[src] folder are present in that project as well.
  Otherwise tests will/should fail.
. Open Test Explorer (menu:Rubberduck[Unit Tests > Test Explorer])
. Run the tests by clicking: menu:Run[All Tests]

== Used By

This project is used by (at least) these projects:

* https://github.com/VBA-tools2/PolynomReg.vba[]

If you know more, I'll be happy to add them here.

== Known issues and limitations

None that I am aware of.

== Contributing

All contributions are highly welcome!!

If you are new to git/GitHub, please have a look at {uri-GitHub-FirstContribution} where you will find a lot of useful information for beginners.

I recently was pointed to {uri-commit-messages} which sounds very promising.
I'll use them from now on too (and hopefully don't forget it in a hurry).

== FAQ

. What are the `+'@...+` comments good for in the code?
  You should really have a look at the awesome {uri-rubberduck}[Rubberduck] project!

== License

{uri-license}[MIT]
